# Course-work-on-the-topic-generation-of-combinatorial-objects-in-Java
This course work is devoted to the generation of combinatorial objects, namely the generation of permutations and the generation of the division of numbers into terms.
In the course work, algorithms such as the Hip algorithm, the algorithm for generating all partitions of a number, as well as the algorithm for generating partitions of a number n into m terms are considered.
